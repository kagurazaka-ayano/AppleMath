# Apple Math

A header-only wrapper for apple simd library, currently only support vector and matricies

This library is more of a personal-use library, so will only update when I think new function is necessary

Make sure you are using C++23 when using this library (use "set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 23) set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)" in CMakeLists.txt or add -std=c++23 in compiler flag) because there will be error if you don't use C++23 standard
